      content : I had the pleasure of working with Hamady during his short yet exciting tenure at nventive. In terms of professionalism, determination and work ethics, Hamady certainly ranks among the best. A perfect example of "doing what he says, and saying what he does", good communication was also one of the aspects I always appreciated working with Hamady. I hope we will have the chance to work together again!
